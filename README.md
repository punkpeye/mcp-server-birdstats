      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-birdstats"]
    },

## Usage

The plugin processes natural language queries about your bird detection data. Example queries:

- "My BirdNET heard a Swainson's Thrush - is that unusual?"
- "What's my station's rarest detection this week?"
- "Graph my detections by time of day"
- "Are others seeing these warblers on eBird?"

## Data Integrity

This plugin strictly adheres to data integrity principles:
- Only uses actual API response data
- Never creates example or estimated data
- Always shows observation counts with percentages
- Clear indication when data is unavailable

## Core Logic

The core functionality is contained in a single text file under `src/index.txt` which includes:
- BirdWeather API interactions
- eBird API interactions
- Data analysis functions
- Type definitions
- Helper utilities

## API Integration

### BirdWeather API
- Station statistics
- Species lists
- Detection records

### eBird API
- Recent observations
- Notable sightings
- Hotspot data
- Species information
